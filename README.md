# User Agent Anatomizer

A user agent anatomizer (still in ALPHA). Given a list of user agent strings, parses them and generates a report based on browser (and version), operating system and device. **At the moment, the report generated is shown in your browser's console**.

You can find the current version [here](https://edwarddamato.github.io/ua-anatomizer/index.html).
